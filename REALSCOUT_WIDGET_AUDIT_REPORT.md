# 🔧 RealScout Widget Audit & Repair Report

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Found & Fixed**

### **1. Script Loading Problems**
**Issue**: Each widget was loading different, incorrect script URLs
- ❌ `realscout.com/widgets/office-listings.js` (incorrect)
- ❌ `realscout.com/widgets/simple-search.js` (incorrect)
- ❌ `realscout.com/widgets/home-value.js` (incorrect)
- ❌ `realscout.com/widgets/advanced-search.js` (incorrect)

**✅ Fixed**: Now uses single unified script
- ✅ `widgets.realscout.com/realscout-widgets.js` (correct)

### **2. CSS Loading Missing**
**Issue**: No CSS was being loaded from your Cloudflare DNS worker
- ❌ Widgets had no styling, appeared broken

**✅ Fixed**: Now loads CSS from Cloudflare DNS worker
- ✅ `widgets.realscout.com/realscout-widgets.css`
- ✅ Added `crossOrigin="anonymous"` for security

### **3. Widget Initialization Issues**
**Issue**: No proper initialization after script loading
- ❌ Widgets loaded but didn't render properly
- ❌ No fallback initialization methods

**✅ Fixed**: Multiple initialization methods
- ✅ `window.initRealScoutWidgets()`
- ✅ `window.RealScout.init()` (fallback)
- ✅ Proper timing with setTimeout

### **4. Duplicate Resource Loading**
**Issue**: Each widget tried to load scripts independently
- ❌ Multiple script tags created
- ❌ Race conditions between widgets

**✅ Fixed**: Centralized loading system
- ✅ Single script load shared across all widgets
- ✅ Deduplication prevents multiple loads
