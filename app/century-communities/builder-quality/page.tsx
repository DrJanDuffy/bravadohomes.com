          Why Builder Quality Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 text-center mb-10 max-w-4xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
          Builder quality directly affects your ownership experience, maintenance costs, and resale confidence.
          For Bravado buyers, understanding construction standards and design consistency helps you evaluate long-term value,
          not just move-in features.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Construction Standards</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Quality starts with repeatable standards across framing, systems, and finishes. Buyers should compare
              workmanship consistency, inspection response, and closeout quality instead of relying on model-home presentation alone.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              In new construction communities, construction execution often impacts both comfort and ongoing maintenance
              expectations over the first several years of ownership.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Effective floor plan design balances lifestyle flexibility with day-to-day practicality: storage, flow,
              usable square footage, and utility efficiency.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Communities that pair practical layouts with modern systems tend to hold stronger buyer demand when it is time to resell.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Reputation is more than brand size. For buyers, what matters is responsiveness during construction,
            clarity of communication, and post-close follow-through.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Working with dedicated buyer representation helps you track these signals and compare options with
            clear decision criteria before you commit.
